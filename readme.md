# A presentation on roslyn analyzer authoring

To build the presentation locally you will need to install [marp-cli](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli). Then you can create a rendition with a command below:

```shell
marp presentation.md
```

This will produce `presentation.html` and you can just open it in the browser to present.

You can also present directly by adding `-p` command argument:

```shell
marp -p presentation.md
```

Keep in mind that it requires a chromium based browser installed on your system.

You can read raw markdown rendition [here](presentation.md)
