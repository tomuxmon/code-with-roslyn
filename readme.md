# A presentation on roslyn analyzer authoring

To build the presentation locally you will need to install [marp-cli](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli)

```shell
marp presentation.md
```

This  will produce `presentation.html` and you can just open it in the browser to present.

You can also present directly:

```shell
marp -p presentation.md
```

keep in mind the it requires chromium based browser installed.

you can read raw markdown rendition [here](presentation.md)
